# Inner Thought / Mental Notes
1. Using *Save Point* & *SP##* to make reminder / checkpoints for myself when returning to my code so I don't forget where I am when I last left off on coding. 
2. Eventually would like to automate this and have it save files to the NAS for a Linux/Windows ISO/Medicat repo
3. Find a way to keep an eye on date differences and automate a download when an "update" happens

## [Linux From Scratch](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=lfs)
Desc: Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with the steps necessary to build your own custom Linux system. There are a lot of reasons why somebody would want to install an LFS system. The question most people raise is "why go through all the hassle of manually installing a Linux system from scratch when you can just download an existing distribution like Debian or Redhat". That is a valid question which I hope to answer for you. The most important reason for LFS's existence is teaching people how a Linux system works internally. Building an LFS system teaches you about all that makes Linux tick, how things work together, and depend on each other. And most importantly, how to customize it to your own taste and needs. 


## [Salient OS](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=salient)
